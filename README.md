# Email-Bot

This project aims to create a robot which can be remotely controlled through email.

Essentially the robot receives an email with a command, executes that movement, and then sends a return image of its new view.
This project is interesting because the robot can be controlled from anywhere in the world, if there is an internet connection.  The significant latency in response time of the robot means this system also emulates long distance communications with high speed satellites (such as Voyager 1 and 2).

As of this push, it takes 15 minutes for a signal to reach Voyager 1!
The email method takes about 5 minutes.

This project uses the Raspberry Pi, and camera module.
